<h3> Happy Fathers Day, Father. I hope you have a wonderful day and I hope you enjoy yourself </h3>

<h5>I know this is a lot different but I wanted to spice it up a bit this year. I re-learnt HTML coding and learnt how to use a better program for it like GitHub and Sublime Text (which required SkillShare courses). I hope this is satisfactory and I hope I met your expecations. :)</h5>
